# Various TODO and Crib Notes

In no particular order ...

## TRIBE Integration
Get it hooked up to TRIBE for consumption-based billing and RBAC.

Bonus points for demonstrating TRIBE being hooked up to stripe or gocardless.com

## Grafana Dashboards
Nice eye-candy

## Other services
Demonstrate other services with different providers to choose from:

    - transcribe

    - translate

## Distributed Attenuation
A redis implementation of the attenuator so that multiple of these can be co-ordinated

## Kubernetes + HELM
Raw kubernetes yaml

Helm charts

## S3 (and other storage) integration for saving requests and responses

## Admin Console
Using the config API to change behaviour in real time
